A console app created on Visual Studio 2022 using C#.
Once you start the app, any number between 1 and 100 that it's remaining when divided by 3 and 5 is equal to 0, will say FizzBuzz.
If it equals 0 only with the number 3, I will say Fizz.
If it equals 0 only with the number 5, I will say Buzz.
And if the ramining is not equal to 0, it will just show the respective number.
